# Study Groups for Data Science

In 2018-2020 dozens of workgroups at Thinkful and on 
various Discord channels were created where we engaged in 6-week project-based meetups. 
This collection of 20+ repos is a result of that work. As of fall 2022,
many remain active, including:

- [ds-study-group](https://github.com/study-groups/ds-study-group): fundamentals of data science
- [devops-study-group](https://github.com/study-groups/devops-study-group): Linux, Dask, Ray
- [js-study-group](https://github.com/study-groups/js-study-group): Frontend HTML/CSS/JS and React
- [live-topic-analysis](https://github.com/study-groups/live-topic-analysis): Docker, Spark
- [sentiment-analysis-engine](https://gitlab.com/zoverlvx/sentiment-analysis-engine)
- [genomics-study-group](https://github.com/study-groups/genomics-study-group): bioinfomatics over graph networks
